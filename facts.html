          <p>Demand for food assistance is rising<br>at an extraordinary rate, and at a food<br>pantry in Queens on Wednesday, the<br>line stretched for eight blocks.</p>
          <p>While COVID-19 keeps construction, sites<br>shuttered, and may workers at home,<br>their families struggle financially<br>because of lost income and<br>exclusion from government aid.</p>

          <p class="sectionHeads2">Nearly 1 in 4 households <br>have experienced food insecurity this year</p>
          <p class ="sectionContent2">Even before the pandemic hit, some 13.7 million households, or 10.5% of all U.S. households, experienced food insecurity at some point during 2019, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That works out to more than 35 million Americans who were either unable to acquire enough food to meet their needs, or uncertain of where their next meal might come from, last year.Even before the pandemic hit, some 13.7 million households, or 10.5% of all U.S. households, experienced food insecurity at some point during 2019, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

          <p class ="sectionContent2">For about a third of these households, access to food was so limited that their eating patterns were disrupted and food intake was reduced. The rest were able to obtain enough food to avoid completely disrupting their eating patterns, but had to cope by eating less varied diets or utilizing food assistance programs.</p>
          <p class ="sectionContent2">The coronavirus pandemic has only worsened the problem. According to one estimate by researchers at Northwestern University, food insecurity more than doubled as a result of the economic crisis brought on by the outbreak, hitting as many as 23% of households earlier this year.</p>
